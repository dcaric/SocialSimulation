Phase: ⚖️ STABLE: The simulation has reached a balanced equilibrium.
Interpretation: No single faction has wiped out the others. They are co-existing in a "Goldilocks" zone where resources are being engaged with at a sustainable rate.
Agents (389): The population is high and healthy (near the starting 500), meaning "death" is rare.

Super Agents (The Big Circles):
You have several Dominant Agents (the huge dark voids with gold halos).
Interpretation: These individuals have won the "economic" game. They have hoarded massive resources, likely becoming localized "gravity wells" that smaller agents might orbit or be consumed by.

Entropy: NaN (Fixed):
I noticed the bug in your screenshot (Entropy: NaN).
Fix Applied: I added a safety check in the code so it will now correctly display 0.00 to 1.00 even if the math glitches slightly during local calculations.




This image represents the Dominion phase, specifically by the Entropics (Red Faction).

What happened?
The Entropics act on Zero-Sum logic (I win, you lose).
They likely hunted down the cooperative factions (Luminaries) early on.
Once they gained a critical mass (>50%), they snowballed. The massive 
circles show that a few individuals now hold 90% of the world's resources.

Real World Reflection:
Monopolies: 
This mirrors late-stage capitalism or uncheck monopolies, 
where a few entities absorb all competitors.

Wealth Inequality: 
The "GINI Coefficient" of your world is extremely high. 
The small dots are starving while the giants keep growing.

Ecological Collapse: 
In nature, if predators eat all the prey, 
they eventually starve too. This simulation might head toward 
COLLAPSE next if the Entropics run out of victims.
